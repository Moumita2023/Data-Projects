### Insights from the Tableau Dashboard:
Here are some key insights from the Tableau HR Employee Attrition Dashboard:

- **Insight 1**: Lower Job level has more attrition than higher job levels which means junior level employees tend to leave organization more frequently than senior level employees.
- **Insight 2**: Overtime has a very high impact on the attrition rate, the more the no. of hours in overtime, the more is attrition.
- **Insight 3**: When the distance from Home is more, the attrition rate is higher
- **Insight 4**: Lifesciences & Medical departments have low attrition rate than other departments, comparitively Marketing department has higher attrition rate
- **Insight 5**: Single employees have more chances of attrition than married. Sales Representative and Single these two combination of job role and marrital status has maximum attrition compared to others.
  
I believe these are some interesting insights which HR department should consider to reduce attrition rate in the organization.
